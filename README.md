# Iris Flower Classification Model
This is my first machine learning model: an Iris Flower Classification model built with scikit-learn.

# Overview
The Iris Flower Classification model is a simple machine learning model used to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This model uses the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is one of the most popular datasets in machine learning and data science. It contains 150 samples divided into three classes of 50 instances each.

# Model
The model was built using the scikit-learn library. I used a simple supervised learning algorithm to classify the iris flowers based on the provided features.

# Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Loaded and analyzed the dataset.
Feature Selection: Selected the four main features.
Model Training: Used various algorithms to train the model, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib (for data visualization)


To install the required libraries, you can use:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/michaelnkema1/iris-flower-classification.git


Run the model:
python iris_model.py


# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95% on the test set, making it a reliable classifier for this dataset.
